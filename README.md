# Retail-project

Problem : One of the problems concerning retail business over the years have been in designing marketing strategies to identify the right customers to target in order to maximize the ROI. This could be achieved through knowledge of customer purchasing behaviour which is majorly influenced by factors such as the Pricing of the products, Product preference and Market presence of the business. This Project aims at identifying patterns in customer purchasing behaviour so that the products reach the target audience.
